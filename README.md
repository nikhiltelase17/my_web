## My Awesome Webpage: A Beginner's Guide

This is the code for a webpage called "My Awesome Webpage." It's a great starting point for anyone new to web development, as it includes various elements commonly found in webpages. 

**What's inside?**

* **Basic Structure:** The code uses the building blocks of HTML to define different sections of the webpage, like the header, body, and footer. You can think of these sections like different areas on a physical page.
* **Content:** The webpage displays various content, including:
    * **Text:** You'll find text about Steve Jobs and a paragraph with a unique font style.
    * **Images & Videos:** The code includes an image and a video, allowing you to showcase visual information.
    * **Maps & Audio:** You can also see an embedded map of San Francisco and an audio player to play music or other audio files.
    * **Links:** The webpage includes links to Youtube and social media profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, WhatsApp).
* **Styling (not included here):** While not included in this code, the webpage references a stylesheet file named "style.css". This file controls the visual appearance of the elements, like their colors, fonts, and layout.
* **Icons:** The code uses Font Awesome icons to display various symbols throughout the webpage, making it more visually appealing.

**Getting Started:**

While this code provides the foundation for a webpage, it wouldn't function on its own. To see the webpage in action, you'll need:

1. **A code editor:** This is a software program where you can write and edit code. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
2. **A web browser:** This is where you'll view the webpage after saving the code. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge are popular choices.

**Steps to view the webpage:**

1. **Save the code:** Copy and paste the code into your code editor and save it as an HTML file (e.g., "index.html").
2. **Open the file in your browser:** Drag and drop the saved HTML file into your web browser, or open it from the file menu within the browser.
